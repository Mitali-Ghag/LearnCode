            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              LearnCode started with a simple idea: **What if learning to code was fun, interactive, and career-focused?**  
              A group of developers and educators came together to build a platform that goes beyond theoryâ€”one that  
              **connects learners with real-world projects, industry experts, and job opportunities**. Today, we  
              have helped thousands of students gain in-demand coding skills and launch their careers.
